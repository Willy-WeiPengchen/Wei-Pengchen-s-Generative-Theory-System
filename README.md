The "Wei Pengchen Generation Theory" is a language generation theoretical system that takes the "Seven Mysteries Generation Theory" as its core and integrates the Eastern cosmology and cognitive philosophy. Wei Pengchen completed the core theory on January 15, 2020, positioning it as a "cognitive model of language generation based on natural laws".
